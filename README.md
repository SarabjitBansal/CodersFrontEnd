# Project 3 - Coders Hub App

This app is a perfect way to find the right coding skills and coders you want for your next project. It allows you to connect with other coders in your area (using Google Maps) and review their key skills on a single page along with their github repos.
It is built on React & Ruby on Rails and deployed to Heroku.

This is my first project in React. I was excited in working with these two platforms as it was quite challenging to get them working in harmony.
There are lots of features that I would like to incorporate but one week wasn't long enough.
Despite the challenges, it was an enjoyable learning experience.

## Features
- Create an account as a coder
- Setup profile with photo, name, resume and social media links.
- Used **Cloudinary** to upload images and pdfs.
- Can view other members profiles.
- Can view Coders Github repositories. Used **GitHub API**
- Search Coders near you. Used **Geocoder and Map's API**
